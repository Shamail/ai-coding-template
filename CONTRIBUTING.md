# Contributing to the AI-Assisted Coding Template

Thank you for considering contributing to this template! Your help is appreciated in making it more robust, comprehensive, and easier to use.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, an inconsistency, outdated information, or a part of the template that is unclear:
- Please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-username/ai-coding-template/issues) (replace with the actual link to your repository's issues page if applicable) on the GitHub repository.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Detail the steps to reproduce the issue or the specific area of concern.
- Mention your environment if relevant (OS, Bun version, etc.).

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements to Rules or Workflows
This template relies heavily on its rules (`.windsurf/rules/`) and workflows (`.windsurf/workflows/`). If you have suggestions for improving them:
- **For minor clarifications or typo fixes in existing files**: You can suggest these directly in an issue or a pull request.
- **For more significant changes or new content**:
    1.  Follow the guidelines in `.windsurf/rules/workflows_guidelines.md` for documenting friction and enhancement ideas in `docs/workflow-enhancements.md`. This is a good place to start a discussion.
    2.  You can then propose changes via a pull request.

### 3. Proposing New Rules or Workflows
If you believe a new rule or workflow would be beneficial:
- First, consider opening an issue to discuss the proposal. This allows for feedback before significant effort is invested.
- If you create a new rule or workflow, ensure it follows the existing structure and conventions:
    - Rules should be in Markdown, located in `.windsurf/rules/`, and include YAML frontmatter for `description` and potentially `trigger` or `globs`.
    - Workflows should be in Markdown, located in `.windsurf/workflows/`, and include YAML frontmatter for `description`.

### 4. Improving Documentation
Improvements to `README.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, or other documentation are always welcome. This includes clarifications, correcting errors, or adding helpful information.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository** (if you are not a direct collaborator).
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature` or `fix/issue-description`).
3.  **Make your changes**. Ensure you adhere to the project's existing coding style (primarily for any scripts or config files) and documentation format.
4.  **Test your changes** if applicable (e.g., if modifying scripts or configurations).
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6.  **Push your branch** to your fork.
7.  **Open a pull request** against the main branch of the original repository.
    - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the "what" and "why" of your changes.
    - Link to any relevant issues.
