# Product Plan Generation Workflow

## Overview
This workflow transforms your business plan into a concrete product plan by defining core functionalities, user personas, and success metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Completed business plan (docs/product/business_plan.md)
- Clear product vision
- Understanding of desired product scope

## Steps

1. **Review Business Plan**
   - Analyze the completed business plan from the previous workflow
   - Identify key business objectives that the product must address
   - Note any constraints or requirements mentioned in the business plan

2. **Define Product Vision**
   - Articulate a clear product vision statement
   - Determine the scope of the initial product release
   - Identify potential future expansions beyond the initial scope

3. **Generate Product Plan**
   - Use Windsurf AI to create a comprehensive product plan including:
     - Core Functionalities: List of essential features
     - User Personas: Detailed descriptions of target users
     - Success Metrics: KPIs to measure product success
     - Feature Prioritization: MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
     - High-level Technical Requirements

4. **Review and Refine**
   - Evaluate the generated product plan
   - Make adjustments to align with business objectives
   - Ensure technical feasibility of proposed features

5. **Create Output Directory**
   - Ensure the output directory `docs/product/` exists. If not, create it.
   - Command: `mkdir -p docs/product`

6. **Finalize Product Plan**
   - Save the finalized product plan as a markdown document
   - Store at docs/product/product_plan.md for reference in subsequent workflows

## Output
A detailed product plan document (docs/product/product_plan.md) that will guide the development of epics and user stories in the next workflows.
