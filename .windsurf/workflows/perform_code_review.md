# AI-Assisted Code Review Workflow

## Overview
This workflow integrates AI to enhance the code review process, improving efficiency and quality. AI assists human reviewers, focusing on early issue detection and allowing reviewers to concentrate on higher-level concerns.

## Prerequisites
- Code committed to a feature branch and a Pull Request (PR) created.
- Access to approved AI coding assistant tools.
- Familiarity with project guidelines (`coding_conventions.md`, `project_structure.md`, `prompt_engineering_guidelines.md`).

## Steps

1.  **Automated Static Analysis:**
    *   Ensure standard linting, formatting, and static analysis checks pass before or during PR submission. This catches basic issues automatically.

2.  **AI Pre-Screening (Author - Optional):**
    *   Author uses AI to self-review code for bugs, guideline adherence, clarity, edge cases, and potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Author analyzes AI feedback and makes revisions before formal review.

3.  **AI-Assisted Review (Reviewer):**
    *   Reviewer uses AI to understand complex code sections.
    *   Reviewer employs AI to identify potential logic errors, concurrency issues, SOLID principle violations, or performance bottlenecks.
    *   AI can help draft constructive review comments.
    *   **Crucial:** Critically evaluate all AI suggestions.

4.  **Human Review and Decision:**
    *   Reviewer synthesizes their own analysis with AI-assisted findings.
    *   Focus on architecture, logic, requirements, and maintainability.
    *   Make the final decision (approve, request changes, merge). Human expertise is paramount.

5.  **Document Key AI Findings (Optional):**
    *   If AI provides significant insights or identifies critical issues, note them in PR comments or team knowledge base for shared learning.

## Output
- A thoroughly reviewed Pull Request with higher code quality.
- Improved understanding of code changes by both author and reviewer.
- Shared learnings from AI-assisted findings.
