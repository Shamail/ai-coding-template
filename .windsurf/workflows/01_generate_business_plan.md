# Business Plan Generation Workflow

## Overview
This workflow uses Windsurf AI to help create a concise, structured business plan for your project.

## Prerequisites
- A clear understanding of your core business idea.
- Knowledge of your target market.
- A defined problem statement.
- A unique value proposition.

## Steps

1.  **Provide Business Information**
    *   Define your core business idea (1-2 sentences).
    *   Identify target market and customer segments.
    *   Articulate the problem you're solving.
    *   Explain your unique value proposition.

2.  **Generate Business Plan Draft**
    *   Instruct Windsurf AI to draft a business plan including:
        *   Executive Summary
        *   Problem/Solution Analysis
        *   Target Market Description
        *   Basic Revenue Model
        *   Key Objectives and Milestones

3.  **Review and Refine**
    *   Review the AI-generated business plan.
    *   Make necessary adjustments to align with your vision.
    *   Ensure all sections are clear, comprehensive, and accurate.

4.  **Create Output Directory**
    *   Ensure the output directory `docs/product/` exists. If not, create it.
    *   Command: `mkdir -p docs/product`

5.  **Finalize Business Plan**
    *   Save the finalized plan as a markdown document.
    *   Store at `docs/product/business_plan.md` for use in subsequent workflows.
