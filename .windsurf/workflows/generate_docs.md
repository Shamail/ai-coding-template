# AI-Assisted Documentation Generation Workflow

## Overview
This workflow outlines using AI to generate and update various project documents. This includes READMEs, code comments (e.g., JSDoc/TSDoc), architectural diagrams/explanations, and user guides. The aim is to improve documentation quality and consistency while saving developer time.

**Note:** This workflow is foundational. Specific AI prompts and advanced techniques will be detailed in future iterations or specialized sub-workflows.

## Prerequisites
- Access to approved AI coding assistant tools.
- Familiarity with `prompt_engineering_guidelines.md`.
- Clearly defined scope for the documentation to be generated (e.g., specific module, feature, or entire project).
- Existing code or project artifacts (if documentation is to be derived from them).

## Steps

1.  **Define Documentation Scope and Audience:**
    *   Identify the type of documentation needed (e.g., README, code comments, user guide).
    *   Define the target audience (e.g., developers, end-users, new team members).

2.  **Gather Context for AI:**
    *   Provide AI with relevant source code, project structure information, existing documentation, user stories, or design documents.
    *   For code comments, specify the function/class and its purpose.

3.  **Generate Draft Documentation with AI:**
    *   Use specific prompts based on the documentation type:
        *   **README:** "Generate a README for a project with [X features], using [Y technologies]. Include sections for Installation, Usage, and Contributing."
        *   **Code Comments:** "Generate JSDoc/TSDoc comments for this function: [code snippet]. Explain its parameters, return value, and purpose."
        *   **Architectural Explanation:** "Explain the architecture of this module [provide code/diagram context] focusing on [key components and interactions]."
        *   **User Guide Section:** "Write a user guide section on how to use [feature X], based on these steps/user story: [details]."

4.  **Review and Refine AI Output:**
    *   Critically review the AI-generated draft for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and tone.
    *   Edit and augment the content with human expertise. Ensure technical accuracy and fill any gaps.
    *   Verify that the documentation meets the needs of the target audience.

5.  **Integrate and Maintain:**
    *   Add the generated/updated documentation to the project repository (e.g., `docs/` folder, inline code comments).
    *   Establish a process for keeping documentation up-to-date as the project evolves, potentially using AI for updates as well.

## Output
- Draft or updated project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, code comments, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/guides/user_guide.md`).
- Improved consistency and coverage of project documentation.
